# Framer Frontend

This frontend was built using Framer, a web-based design and prototyping tool.

The UI consists of two main components:

1.  **Image Uploader:** Allows users to upload an image of construction debris.
2.  **Chatbot Interface:** Provides a conversational interface for users to ask questions about the analyzed debris and potential reuse cases.

The Framer project is linked to a GitHub repository, and the site is deployed using GitHub Pages.
