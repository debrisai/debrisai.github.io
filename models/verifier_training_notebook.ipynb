    "\n",
    "The first step in training a verifier model is to collect and label a dataset of construction debris images. This dataset would be used to train a model to classify images based on material type and reuse potential.",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sources:**",
    "\n",
    "*   **Field Data:** Collect images from construction sites, demolition projects, and recycling centers.",
    "*   **Synthetic Data:** Generate synthetic images of debris to augment the dataset.",

    "**Labeling:**",
    "\n",
    "*   **Material Type:** Label images with the primary material (e.g., brick, concrete, wood, metal).",
    "*   **Reuse Feasibility:** Assign a score from 0 to 100 indicating the feasibility of reuse.",
    "*   **Expert Review:** Have subject matter experts review and verify the labels."

    "4.  **Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune the model on the labeled debris dataset.",
    "5.  **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on a held-out test set."

    "**Deployment Steps:**",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Save the Model:** Save the trained model in a format compatible with Vertex AI (e.g., TensorFlow SavedModel).",
    "2.  **Create a Vertex AI Endpoint:** Create a new endpoint on Vertex AI to serve the model.",
    "3.  **Integrate with the Backend:** Update the backend to call the verifier model's endpoint after receiving the initial analysis from Gemini."
